# [ListOfFriends](https://github.com/jaimemendozadev/ListOfFriends)


ListOfFriends is a simple app for storing a List of your friends. Each friend should have an unique email, profile picture, description. As a user, you should be able to sign in/sign up and view/edit your profile while viewing the profiles of other registered users on the site.

*Note*: This is merely a scaffolding of an app and in no way to complete. The following components still need to be build:

- A working Sign In Page component for signing in returning authenticated users.

- A working Dashboard component that allows a user to edit his/her profile, including email, bio, and upload a photo

- A Friends Feed that allows an authenticated user to view the profiles of other registered users of the app.

- App still needs user validation for inputing email/password info and error handling in case authentication fails on backend.

- App still needs to be hooked up to the backend to retrieve other user profiles to display on frontend.

- Overall app state needs to be designed implemented in Redux store.
